# NatHazard-US
Multivariate Statistical Assessment of Natural Hazard Risk in the United States


This repository contains R scripts for analyzing county and state-level risk data using various multivariate statistical techniques. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and clustering.

## Files

- `county_analysis.R`: Analysis of county-level risk data.
- `state_analysis.R`: Analysis of state-level risk data.

## Requirements

- R programming language
- Required R packages:
  - `dplyr`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `cluster`
  - `MASS`
  - `mvnormtest`
  - `mvtnorm`
  - `psych`

### Steps

1. **Load and inspect data**

2. **Sample and clean data**

3. **Statistical analysis**
   - Pairs plot and correlation matrix
   - Variance-covariance matrix
   - Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances

4. **Normality testing**

5. **Clustering**
   - Hierarchical clustering
   - K-means clustering

## Additional Analysis

- Hierarchical clustering results are saved to text files for further analysis (e.g., in Tableau).
